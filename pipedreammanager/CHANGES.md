# API Client Fixes

## Changes Made to Fix API Client Issues

1. Created a centralized API client module (`utils/api-client.js`) with:
   - Consistent versioning support (v1/v2)
   - Standardized error handling
   - Better fallback mechanisms
   - Method-specific helper functions
   - Support for different endpoint patterns

2. Updated command files to use the centralized API client:
   - `commands/download.js`
   - `commands/list-workflows.js`
   - `commands/list-triggers.js`
   - `commands/list-steps.js`
   - `commands/create-workflow.js`

3. Key improvements:
   - Version handling: Added support for both v1 and v2 API endpoints with automatic fallback
   - Better endpoint discovery: Tries multiple endpoint patterns when initial requests fail
   - Consistent error reporting: Standardized error handling across all commands
   - Improved debugging: Added more logging for API operations with clearer messages
   - Organization/workspace handling: Better support for different org structures
   - Reduced code duplication: Centralized common API-related code

4. API Client Features:
   - `makeRequest()`: Core method for making API requests with version control
   - `tryBothVersions()`: Helper to try both v1 and v2 APIs with fallback
   - `getUserDetails()`: Reliable method to get user and organization info
   - `getProjects()`: Get projects with fallback mechanisms
   - `getProjectWorkflows()`: Get workflows with multiple endpoint patterns
   - `getWorkflow()`: Get workflow details with fallbacks
   - `getWorkflowCode()`: Get workflow code with fallbacks
   - `getWorkflowTriggers()`: Get workflow triggers with extraction fallback
   - `getWorkflowSteps()`: Get workflow steps with extraction fallback

These changes resolve the issues mentioned in the design document regarding the API endpoints for listing workflows and triggers returning 404 errors, and provide a more robust foundation for future API interactions.
