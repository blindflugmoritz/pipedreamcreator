Create a Pipedream {{componentType}} component with the following details:

- Name: {{name}}
- Key: {{key}}
- Description: {{description}}
- App: {{app}}

Please provide complete working code following these requirements:

1. Follow the standard Pipedream component structure
2. Include all necessary imports
3. Define appropriate props with proper types and descriptions
4. Implement all required methods
5. Include helpful code comments
6. Follow best practices for error handling

For source/trigger components:
- Implement appropriate deduplication logic
- Include hooks for initialization and cleanup
- Implement proper event emission with metadata

For action components:
- Validate inputs
- Return appropriate response objects
- Export a summary

The code should be production-ready, following Pipedream's patterns and conventions. Do not include any explanations before or after the code - just the component implementation as an ES module (mjs file).
