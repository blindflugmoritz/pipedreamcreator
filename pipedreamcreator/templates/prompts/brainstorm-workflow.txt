I'd like you to help me design a Pipedream workflow for the following use case:

{{description}}

Please provide a complete workflow design including:

1. The appropriate trigger type (HTTP, schedule, or app-specific)
2. Required steps with proper sequence
3. Data transformation requirements between steps
4. Error handling considerations 
5. Expected inputs and outputs

For each component, please specify:
- Component type (source/trigger or action)
- Required properties and configuration
- Data flow between components
- Edge cases to handle

Format your response as a structured workflow design with clear sections for:
- Overview
- Trigger Component
- Processing Steps
- Final Action
- Error Handling

Please be specific about which Pipedream apps and actions would be used in this workflow, providing as much technical detail as possible while keeping it practical and implementable.
